<p>  My elementary school days was nice. I really enjoyed being an elementary student. I have a lot nice friends and classmates. I also remember my favorite teacher on my elementary days. Her name is Ms. Balatbat. I love her because she is so nice and good at teaching. I wish I can go back to my elementary days so that I enjoy again being a kid.
